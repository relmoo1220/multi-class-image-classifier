# Multi-Class Image Classifier using Tensorflow Keras

This project uses Tensorflow Keras to build a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to predict if the brain mri image has tumour.

### Please install Tensorflow and Matplotlib before running the code
```
pip install tensorflow matplotlib
```
